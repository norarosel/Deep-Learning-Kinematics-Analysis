# DeepLearningKinematicsAnalysis
Computer Vision project: enhancing motor learning through non-invasive striatal stimulation (tTIS) in healthy older adults and individuals with brain lesions. Applied deep learning to analyze kinematic data from stroke patients performing motor learning tasks, aiming to identify movement patterns and advance neurorehabilitation research. (2025).
